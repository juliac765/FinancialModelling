# Financial Modeling with Python 📈

This repository contains a Python script that retrieves, analyzes, and visualizes stock data using **Yahoo Finance, Matplotlib, and Plotly**.

## Overview
The script downloads adjusted closing prices for three stocks:  
- **Apple (AAPL)**
- **Louis Vuitton (MC.PA)**
- **UnitedHealth Group (UNH)**

the script:
Calculates **daily returns, cumulative returns, and annualized volatility**  
Computes and visualizes the **Sharpe Ratio** to assess risk-adjusted performance  
Plots **historical stock prices and cumulative portfolio returns**  

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **1️⃣ Install Dependencies**
Ensure you have Python installed, then install required libraries.
I had an issue with yfinance, ensure you have version 0.2.54 installed and on the same file path as your script. If you don't have this version, there will be too many pull requests from yf.
